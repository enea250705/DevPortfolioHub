Case Study: How a New Website Increased Conversions by 40%
Introduction: In today’s digital-first market, a company’s website is often the prime driver of sales and leads. This case study explores how one business transformed their outdated website into a high-converting marketing machine. We’ll call the company TechServices Co., a B2B service provider that offers IT consulting. TechServices Co. was facing a common challenge: plenty of site visitors, but very few conversions (in their case, “conversion” meant visitors filling out a contact form for a consultation). Their old website was content-heavy, slow, and not mobile-friendly – resulting in a conversion rate of just ~1.5%. They undertook a comprehensive website redesign and optimization project. The result? A 40% increase in conversion rate (from 1.5% to roughly 2.1% of visitors contacting them), along with improved user engagement and SEO performance. Let’s dive into what was done and the key takeaways for improving any website’s conversion rate.
Background: Identifying the Problems
Before the redesign, TechServices Co.’s website had several issues holding it back:
Slow Loading Pages: The homepage took around 5-6 seconds to fully load due to large image files and bloated scripts. This was a huge red flag because 53% of visitors will leave if a page takes longer than 3 seconds to load​

. In other words, more than half of potential clients were likely bouncing before they even saw what TechServices Co. had to offer. Slow speed not only frustrates users, it also hurts search rankings (Google prioritizes fast sites). Research shows even a 1-second delay can cause a noticeable drop in conversions (around 7% fewer conversions per second delay)​

.
Poor Mobile Experience: The site wasn’t mobile-optimized. On a smartphone, text was tiny, menus were hard to tap, and some elements broke out of the screen. This was a critical oversight given that over 60% of web traffic now comes from mobile devices​
THORNWOODDIGITAL.COM
. When mobile visitors landed on the old site, they often gave up quickly – the mobile bounce rate was very high. Considering the majority of their email marketing clicks and social media visits were on mobile, this was a major loss of potential leads.
Unclear Call-to-Action (CTA): The old homepage had no prominent call-to-action. The navigation menu was cluttered with dozens of links, and the key action – “Request a Consultation” – was buried as a small link in the footer. Visitors weren’t being guided toward converting. (This is unfortunately common; around 70% of small business websites lack a clear call-to-action on their homepage​
FORBES.COM
.) Without obvious next steps, users would read a bit and then leave without contacting the company.
Outdated Design and Content: Aesthetically, the site looked like it was built a decade ago – a very text-heavy layout, generic stock photos, and dark colors that didn’t match the company’s current branding. First impressions matter: 75% of consumers admit to judging a company’s credibility based on website design​
WIX.COM
. In TechServices Co.’s case, the outdated look likely made them seem behind-the-times in the tech industry, potentially undermining trust. Additionally, the content was organized in a confusing way (services were listed across multiple pages with redundant info). New visitors couldn’t quickly grasp what solutions were offered or how to engage.
Limited Trust Signals: The old site lacked elements like client testimonials, case studies, or trust badges. For a consulting company, building trust online is key – prospective clients want to see proof that the company is competent and reliable. The absence of these elements meant the site wasn’t doing enough to overcome skepticism or answer the question “Why choose TechServices Co.?”
No Analytics or Conversion Tracking: Surprisingly, they hadn’t set up proper analytics event tracking on the contact form. This meant they had patchy data on where conversions were coming from or where users dropped off in the funnel. They knew the overall conversion rate (via form submissions in email), but not much about user behavior leading up to it. Without that, optimizing was shooting in the dark.
Initial Conversion Metrics
To quantify the starting point: out of roughly 10,000 monthly visitors, only about 150 were submitting the consultation form – a 1.5% conversion rate. Industry benchmarks for B2B services vary, but 1.5% was on the low side. The bounce rate on the homepage was about 70%, and average time on site was under 1 minute – signs that users weren’t engaging deeply. Mobile conversion was almost nonexistent (the few conversions they got were mostly desktop users). These metrics set the stage for improvement. The goal was to boost the conversion rate to at least 2.0% (a ~33% relative increase), and ideally even higher, by addressing the site’s weaknesses.
The Redesign and Optimization Strategy
TechServices Co. partnered with a web development and UX team (let’s say CodeWithEnea, since that’s our context) to overhaul their site. The strategy involved several key steps and improvements: 1. Research & Data Analysis: Before making changes, the team conducted an in-depth analysis:
They set up heatmaps and session recordings on the old site to see where users clicked and where they got frustrated. This revealed, for example, that almost no one scrolled to the bottom of the homepage (where the old CTA was); users tended to abandon the page about halfway through.
They also ran user tests – having a few people in the target audience navigate the site and give feedback. Common feedback was “It’s not clear what I should do next” and “I had trouble finding information on mobile.”
Analytics was properly configured (Google Analytics and conversion funnels) to establish baseline metrics on each step (landing page -> services page -> contact form, etc.). This would later help measure improvements on a granular level.
2. Simplified, Modern Design: The design was completely revamped for a modern, clean look:
The new homepage featured a clear value proposition headline (“Empowering Your Business with Smart IT Solutions”) and a prominent CTA button saying “Request a Free Consultation”. This bright, contrasting button appears in the hero section – immediately visible without scrolling.
The navigation menu was trimmed down to key sections. Instead of 10+ top-level links, they reduced it to five (Services, About, Case Studies, Blog, Contact). A simpler menu helps guide users rather than overwhelm them.
Visually, they adopted a lighter color scheme with the company’s branding, used professional photos of the team (rather than cliché stock images), and plenty of whitespace for a less cluttered feel. Sections were broken up with icons and infographics to illustrate points, making content more digestible. This addresses that crucial first impression – now visitors see a polished, up-to-date site which boosts credibility.
Importantly, responsive design was prioritized. The new site was built mobile-first, ensuring layouts adapt elegantly to smaller screens. On mobile, the menu collapses into a clear hamburger icon, the CTA is a tappable bar, and text is large enough to read without zooming. During design, the team constantly previewed on phones and tablets to get it right.
3. Performance Optimization: The developers tackled the slow load times with several actions:
They optimized images (compressing them and using modern formats). The huge banner image that was 2MB is now a compressed 200KB file, for instance.
They minimized and combined files – scripts and CSS were reduced and deferred where possible so they don’t block page rendering. Unnecessary third-party scripts (there was an unused chat widget and some heavy animation libraries) were removed.
Moved to a better hosting setup with caching and a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to serve content faster regionally. The combined effect was dramatic: the homepage that took ~5 seconds to load now loads in about 2 seconds on desktop and under 3 seconds on mobile. This is within user expectations and means far fewer visitors bounce due to speed. (Recall that previously a large portion left after 3+ seconds; now that risk is mitigated.)
4. Clear Calls-to-Action and User Journey: Every key page on the site was restructured with a conversion-focused mindset:
The homepage now funnels visitors with two primary options: “Learn More” (scrolls to an overview of services) and the “Request Consultation” CTA. As users scroll, they see service highlights with small “Get Started” buttons, and testimonials, and again a CTA at the bottom. There’s always a next step presented.
Service pages (e.g., “Cloud Consulting”, “Cybersecurity Services”) were rewritten to focus on benefits for the client, and each has a sidebar contact form or CTA button. Rather than just describing services, these pages ended with a strong invitation like “Ready to secure your business? Let’s talk.”
The Contact page was simplified – from a daunting 15-field form to just 5 essential fields (name, business email, company, phone, message). By reducing friction, users are more likely to complete the form. Additionally, a phone number and email are provided for those who prefer that, along with a note that “Response within 1 business day” to set expectations.
They also added a sticky header – as you scroll, the top menu with a “Contact Us” button remains visible. On mobile, a sticky footer bar has a phone icon and a contact button. This way, whenever a visitor decides to act, the opportunity is one tap away.
Visual cues for CTA: The new design uses contrast color for all CTA elements, making them stand out. There’s also some subtle animation (like the consultation button gently pulsing) to draw the eye. These techniques guide the user’s attention to conversion points without being obnoxious.
5. Building Trust and Social Proof: To improve conversions, the site needed to reassure visitors that TechServices Co. is experienced and trustworthy:
They included client testimonials throughout the site. On the homepage, a carousel showcases quotes from happy clients (with names, titles, and company names for authenticity). For example: “TechServices Co. helped us increase productivity by 30% — John D., CFO of RetailCorp”.
A new “Case Studies” section was added, detailing real projects and results. One case study shows how a new IT system implemented by TechServices Co. saved a client 20% in costs. This not only provides proof of expertise but also uses a storytelling approach that keeps potential clients engaged (it’s more persuasive than just listing services).
Logos of notable clients were added (“Trusted by [Client A], [Client B], ...”) to give immediate visual credibility.
The site also highlighted certifications and partnerships (e.g., Microsoft Partner, Cisco Certified) with their logos – these serve as trust badges indicating the company’s qualifications.
Last but not least, they published an updated About Us page with team photos and a personable story of the company. People connect with people, so showing the faces behind the company builds trust. It assures potential customers that real, competent professionals are ready to help them.
6. Enhanced Content and SEO: While the focus was conversions, they also improved content structure which aided SEO (and thus traffic, indirectly boosting conversions by bringing more visitors):
They researched keywords and ensured each service page was optimized for a target search term (like “IT consulting for small business”). They added relevant headings, meta descriptions, and ensured the site had an SEO-friendly URL structure.
They started a blog with valuable articles (like “5 Ways to Improve Your Network Security”). This serves two purposes: attracting organic traffic and demonstrating expertise to site visitors. One of the first blog posts even gained traction and brought in some additional traffic.
They fixed technical SEO issues from the old site: broken links were redirected, an XML sitemap and proper schema markup (for things like business info and reviews) were added. These changes help Google index and rank the site better.
Internally, content was interlinked. For instance, a case study about cloud migration links to the Cloud Services page and the Contact page. This makes navigation easier for users and signals relevance to search engines.
Throughout these improvements, the team kept a conversion-centric mindset. They frequently asked, “How does this change help a potential customer take action?” If something didn’t add to that goal, it was trimmed or adjusted. The redesign wasn’t just about looking pretty – it was about communicating clearly and prompting action.
Results: A 40% Conversion Uplift and More
After launching the new website, TechServices Co. saw significant improvements across the board. Here are the key outcomes observed in the three months post-redesign (compared to the three months prior):
Conversion Rate Increased by 40%: The primary goal was achieved. The overall website conversion rate jumped from 1.5% to about 2.1%. In practical terms, instead of 150 leads per 10k visitors, they were now getting around 210 leads per 10k visitors. This is a substantial boost for their sales pipeline. It’s worth noting that this improvement didn’t happen by magic; it’s directly tied to the changes – faster pages, clearer CTAs, and better user experience. For example, the Contact form submissions went up by 40% even though traffic remained roughly steady, indicating visitors who would have left before were now converting. One telling metric: the homepage’s CTA button got a lot of clicks (tracked via analytics), where previously the equivalent action was rarely used.
Mobile Conversions Soared: Perhaps the most dramatic change was on mobile. Previously, mobile users made up maybe 50% of traffic but only a tiny fraction of conversions (the form was nearly unusable on a phone). After the mobile-friendly redesign, the mobile conversion rate tripled. Now mobile visitors were converting almost as well as desktop visitors. The mobile bounce rate dropped by 40% (from ~60% down to ~36% on key landing pages)​

, demonstrating how the improved experience kept people engaged. This aligns with general trends – when a site is mobile-optimized, you tap into that large audience effectively, instead of losing them. (Remember, mobile matters more than ever, and if your site isn’t mobile-friendly, you’re missing out on customers​

.)
Improved User Engagement: On average, visitors were viewing more pages and spending more time on the site. The average pages per session went from 2.0 to about 3.5, and average session duration doubled from ~1 minute to ~2 minutes. This indicates that the content restructuring was working – people were exploring multiple pages (e.g., reading a case study or checking multiple service offerings, then going to Contact). A higher engagement often correlates with higher likelihood of conversion, as users are clearly finding the content relevant. In analytics, the new blog and case study pages showed healthy time-on-page, meaning visitors found them worth reading.
Lower Bounce Rate: Site-wide bounce rate improved significantly (visitors were less likely to leave immediately). The homepage bounce rate specifically went from ~70% to ~50%. While bounce rate can depend on many factors, a drop like this strongly suggests the homepage was now immediately connecting with users – either through its clearer message or faster load (likely both). A 20 percentage-point improvement means hundreds of extra users sticking around each day rather than bailing. Similarly, important landing pages (like those tied to Google Ads campaigns) saw bounce rate reductions, meaning the landing page optimizations (speed, message match, clear next steps) were effective.
SEO and Traffic Gains: Within 2-3 months, the site’s search rankings improved due to better SEO structure and faster performance. TechServices Co. started ranking on the first page for a couple of their targeted service keywords locally. Organic traffic grew by about 25% in that quarter. This was a welcome bonus – more traffic and a higher conversion rate is a winning combination. For example, the “Cloud Consulting” page moved from page 3 to page 1 on Google for “small business cloud consulting [city]”, driving a steady stream of qualified visitors. The SEO gains can partly be credited to the new content (blog posts being shared, case studies providing keyword-rich material) and to technical fixes (Google rewarding the mobile-friendly, fast site with better positions).
Quality of Leads Improved: The marketing team noted that the inquiries coming through were more detailed and higher intent than before. Possibly the content on the site (like case studies and testimonials) pre-answered many questions and attracted more serious prospects. They reported that many new leads referenced something they read on the site (“I saw you helped a client in healthcare improve their IT, we’re looking for something similar…”), which shows the content was doing a job of pre-selling. This is harder to quantify, but the sales team felt the conversion project not only brought more leads, but better leads.
Secondary Conversions: Besides the main consultation form, other conversion goals improved. Newsletter sign-ups increased (they placed a sign-up form on the blog and got a 15% boost in subscribers). Resource downloads (they added a couple of free PDF guides as lead magnets) also took off, giving the company additional contacts to nurture. These micro-conversions are important as they widen the top of the funnel.
To visualize one aspect of improvement, consider the SEO performance after the changes. Below is a sample 90-day performance dashboard showing search impressions and clicks trending upward as the site’s relevance and speed improved: 

SEO performance chart for 90 days post-redesign – Search Impressions (blue line) increased significantly, driving more Clicks (orange line) to the site as average search position improved. Figure: The chart above highlights how better content and faster load times led to more visibility on search engines. Impressions (how often the site appears in search results) grew from about 40k to 90k per quarter, and clicks (actual visits from Google) also rose accordingly. This kind of uptick supported the higher conversion counts, because more visitors were coming in via organic search. It’s a reinforcing cycle: a faster, user-friendly site tends to rank higher, which brings more traffic to convert.
Understanding the 40% Boost
It’s worth breaking down where the conversion improvements came from:
A portion was from capturing would-be bouncers. By speeding up the site and improving mobile layout, a lot of visitors who previously left immediately now stuck around and eventually converted. For instance, many mobile users likely bounced previously, but now a chunk of them stayed and some converted – that alone adds a few percentage points.
Another portion was from guiding undecided users to take action. The clear CTAs and better messaging meant that people who browsed casually before now had their hand held toward the contact form. On the old site, a user might read about a service and think “This sounds good” but not know what to do next; on the new site, that same interest is channeled directly into clicking “Get Started” or filling the short form. The result: previously lost opportunities are now captured.
And some of the lift came from new traffic segments converting – e.g., that additional organic traffic and blog visitors. Even though blog readers are typically higher-funnel, the presence of relevant CTAs (like inline “Need help with this? Contact us!” prompts in blog articles) did yield a trickle of conversions that simply didn’t exist before.
Key Takeaways and Lessons Learned
This case study underscores several important principles in web design and optimization for conversions:
Website Speed is Critical: Users won’t wait around. By optimizing performance (images, code, hosting), TechServices Co. not only improved user experience but also gained favor with Google. A fast site can directly correlate to more conversions – remember how a one-second delay can reduce conversions significantly​
WEMAKEWEBSITES.COM
. Everyone should aim for load times in the 1-3 second range. Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to find and fix bottlenecks. It paid off here with lower bounce rates and happier users.
Mobile-First Approach: If your site isn’t mobile-friendly, you’re likely losing more than half of your potential customers right off the bat. The mobile traffic share is too big to ignore, at roughly 63% of web traffic worldwide​
GS.STATCOUNTER.COM
. Designing for mobile first (then scaling up to desktop) ensures you prioritize what matters. In this case, making the site easy to navigate on a phone removed a huge friction point. Always test your website on actual devices and use Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test. The reward is more engagement and conversions from mobile users, which this company clearly saw.
Clarity in Calls-to-Action: A confused mind doesn’t convert. You must guide visitors on what to do next. TechServices Co.’s old site lacked guidance; the new one made the desired action obvious everywhere. Every page should have a goal. Whether it’s contacting, signing up, or purchasing, make that action stand out. Use contrasting colors, persuasive text (e.g., “Get your free consultation” instead of a boring “Submit”), and position CTAs prominently (usually towards the top and bottom of pages). Also, limit choices – too many options can be paralyzing. Simplifying navigation and focusing on the primary CTA improved the conversion funnel here.
Build Trust and Show Proof: Especially for businesses where a conversion is a significant commitment (like hiring a consultant), visitors need reassurance. Incorporating testimonials, case studies, ratings, or client logos can address doubts. People want to know they’re not the first to trust you. The addition of testimonials and case studies on TechServices Co.’s site likely helped convert skeptical visitors into leads by answering the question “Can they really deliver?”. If you don’t have case studies, even sharing specific success statistics or before-and-after results can help. The key is to back up your claims with evidence.
User-Centric Design: The redesign process considered the user’s perspective at each step – easy navigation, scannable content, and an appealing look. Investing in professional design (or using modern templates) and ensuring consistency with your brand can greatly influence how users perceive you. The stat about 75% judging credibility by design​

 isn’t just trivia; it showed up in this case as well. After redesign, more visitors stuck around and trusted the site. So, make sure your site looks modern and clean, free of clutter, and use visuals that connect with your message.
Iterative Improvement & Testing: The team didn’t just redesign blindly; they used heatmaps, user testing, and analytics to inform changes. Post-launch, they undoubtedly continued monitoring. This iterative mindset is crucial – what works for one audience might not for another, so it’s important to test and refine. A/B testing different headlines or images could further boost conversions. In fact, you should view a website as a living project: collect data, make adjustments, and keep optimizing. Small tweaks, like changing the text of a CTA or the color of a button, can sometimes yield surprising improvements.
Content and SEO Matter Too: While the focus was on conversions, getting more qualified traffic is part of the equation. TechServices Co. benefited from better SEO, which was achieved through quality content and technical fixes. If you undertake a similar project, don’t treat SEO and conversion optimization as separate silos – they complement each other. A well-structured site can simultaneously rank better and convert better. One takeaway is to ensure your site’s content addresses the needs and questions of your ideal customers (which also makes it SEO-friendly). For instance, their blog answering common IT questions likely attracted prospects early in their research, who then found the CTAs to get in touch.
Simplify the Conversion Process: Reducing the number of form fields and making the process straightforward had a direct effect. Always ask: do we really need this info at this stage? Shorter forms mean less friction. Also, having multiple contact options (form, phone, email) caters to user preferences. The easier you make it to convert, the higher your conversion rate will go. This case showed that clearly – the short, prominent form outperformed the buried long form by a wide margin.
Leverage New Content as Lead Generation: The inclusion of valuable content (like whitepapers or newsletters) helped capture leads who weren’t ready to buy immediately. This is a good lesson: not every visitor will convert on the spot, especially in B2B. But you can still capture them into your funnel by offering something of value. Once they’re on your mailing list, you can nurture those leads. So consider adding a secondary conversion like a downloadable guide or webinar sign-up.
Conclusion: Turning Your Website into a Conversion Engine
TechServices Co.’s story is a testament to how a thoughtful website redesign and optimization strategy can directly translate into business growth. A 40% increase in conversion rate meant a significant boost in potential revenue with the same traffic levels. They transformed their website from a static brochure into a dynamic marketing asset that actively generates leads. If your website is underperforming – whether it’s slow, outdated, or not yielding inquiries and sales – it’s likely time for an overhaul. Focus on the user experience: fast loading, mobile-friendly design, clear messaging, and persuasive calls-to-action. Incorporate trust elements and make it absolutely easy for customers to reach out or buy. And don’t forget to analyze results; data should guide your decisions whenever possible. In summary, the key lessons are know your audience, reduce friction, and build trust online. TechServices Co. achieved these through their redesign and saw outstanding results.
